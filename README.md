### Instructions

#### I. Setting up your Github Repository

Andrew Etter highly discourages users to rely on PDFs because inevitably, a PDF file will become severely outdated and the users will either replace the file or outright forget to update the information. In contrast with websites, users will be able to continuously update their websites, which will always contain up-to-date information. Additionally, users will be able to reference their publish website for anyone to view, whereas PDFs must be downloaded and saved in your computer. In this section, we will go over how to set up a Github Repository to host your static generated website, which will contain your resume.

1. Navigate to [Github]()
2. Login to your Github Account
3. Navigate to this [repository]()
4. Press the `Fork` button at the top right of the page
	+ This allows us to create a copy of the repository mentioned in Step 3 so that we can use its template
	
5. Fill out the necessary information in the current page
	+ Name your repository with the following format `(repository name).github.io`
		* Ex. `COMP3040Art.github.io`
		
	+ Leave everything else default
		
6. Press the `Settings` tab at the top of the page
7. Navigate to the `Pages` section on the left sidebar
8. Choose Deploy from branch under Source
9. Change none to main under Branch
10. Press Save

If you wish to view the website, follow the steps 6-7 and the link to your static generated website will be present.

#### II. Editing your Resume

Andrew Etter explains how lightweight markup languages allows anyone to be a contributer because it allows users to quickly write clean documentation using simple syntax to format the users contents. These simple syntaxes create readable information resulting in other people contributing in the improvements of the documents. In this section, we will use Github Desktop to navigate to our files and edit them using our Markdown Text Editor.
