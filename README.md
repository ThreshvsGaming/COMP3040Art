### Instructions

#### I. Setting up your Github Repository

Andrew Etter highly discourages users to rely on PDFs because inevitably, their resume will be severely outdated as the user gains more experience. In contrast with websites, users will be able to continuously update their resumes anytime they want. Additionally, users will be able to reference their publish website to employers, which is always up-to-date. In this section, we will go over how to set up a Github Repository to host your static generated website.

1. Navigate to [Github]()
2. Login to your Github Account
3. Navigate to this [repository]()
4. Select the Fork button at the top right of the page
	+ This allows us to create a copy of the repository mentioned in Step 3 so that we can use its template
	
5. Fill out the necessary information in the current page
	+ Name your repository with the following format `(repository name).github.io`
		* Ex. `Resume.github.io`
		
	+ Leave everything else default
		
6. Select the Settings tab at the top of the page
7. Navigate to the Pages section on the left sidebar
8. Choose Deploy from branch under Source
9. Change none to main under Branch
10. Select Save
